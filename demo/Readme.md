Our paper was presented at the EMBC2025 conference in Copenhagen, where we also participated in a "Demo Fair". In this fair, we demonstrated our method using a short video recording which is being played below. 

In this demo, we annotated locations within the bone mask of a CT scan, where we consequently generated synthetic osteolytic lesions (as was done in the paper). We then ran our bone detection method to identify in which bones these lesions were placed, afterwhich the results are displayed.
