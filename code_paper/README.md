# Code used in the paper

This directory contains several subdirectories that contain snippets of the code used in the paper ......... Note that these are not directly executable, but are added here to provide additional clarity on how the input for the bone detection model was generated. If the research needs to be reproduced, these folders contain the code, although you must organize them yourself.
